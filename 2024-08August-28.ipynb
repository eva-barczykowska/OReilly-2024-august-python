    "# What is a programming language? How does Python fit into this?\n",
    "\n",
    "When computers were first invented, each computer could solve a single problem. If you wanted to change the problem you were solving, or how you were solving it, you needed to build a new computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a certain point, computers then became general purpose. The idea was that you could use the same computer to solve many different problems. This was done by allowing us to write programs. These first programs were just 1s and 0s. But at a certain point, it became clear that no one wants to write with 1s and 0s. The idea of a programming language started. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward to today, and there are tens of thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of programming langauges. All of them allow us to express problems we want to solve, and how we want to solve them, in different ways. However, they're all translated into 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different languages give us different advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- C: Runs very quickly, but we have to write code in a way that's very close to the 1s and 0s. (The translator, known as a compiler, doesn't need to do that much work.)\n",
    "- Java: Runs almost as quickly as C, but is \"higher level,\" meaning that people don't have to work as hard to write it.\n",
    "- Python: Runs very slowly, but is as high-level as you can get -- meaning that it's easy for people to write, easy for people to read (and thus debug), and also handles solving many different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is 30 years old now, but it's very very popular nowadays. It's used in a wide variety of applications:\n",
    "- Web applications\n",
    "- System administration and devops\n",
    "- Data analysis\n",
    "- Machine learning and data science\n",
    "- Education\n",
    "- Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is popular in no small part because it tries to be readable and clear. Once you learn a rule in Python, you can apply it for the rest of your career. There very very few exceptional cases in the language. "

    "# Jupyter (the environment I'm using)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write Python code using an editor (sometimes known as an IDE), and that's fine -- if you have VSCode and/or PyCharm on your computer, you can use that. However, you'll also need to install Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can, if you want to, install Python by going to Python.org, downloading it, and installing it (for free).  But then you'll need to install an editor as well... and it can get complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use Jupyter, which is a Web-based Python system. Installing Jupyter is a little complex (you need to have Python + the Jupyter package). You don't have to! You can use Jupyter via Google Colab, or another Jupyter test system online.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a way to write Python and execute it. It doesn't really matter (for this course) if you use a Web-based notebook, your own Jupyter installation, PyCharm, VSCode, or anything else. The bottom line is you should be able to write Python and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good way to install Python + Jupyter is with Anaconda!"
