    "# Methods vs. functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions and methods are Python's verbs -- that is, they tell Python to do something.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the case of a function, the verb is unattached to any particular object. Its name isn't preceeded by a `.` character; it's freely floating. Some examples are `len` and `sum` and even `int` and `str`, which aren't really functions but we'll call them that for now.\n",
    "- In the case of a method, it has to be anchored to an existing object. It has to have a home of some sort, and that home is always going to be a type of data, such as `str`. So we can't really talk about `strip` or `split`, but we can talk about `str.strip` and `str.split`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, if there is a `.` before a verb's name, then it is a method. If not, then it's a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the many reasons we have methods vs. functions is that this lets us be more precise with both defining and using them. Python can, if I call a method on the wrong kind of object, try to correct me. Certainly an IDE, which has lots of hints and checks, will do that.\n",

    "A function (again) is a verb in Python, that tells Python what to do. We \"execute\" or \"run\" a function by putting round parentheses (`()`) after its name. If you don't use the parentheses, then the function doesn't run! A function is a plan for execution, and only with the `()` does anything actually get executed.\n",
